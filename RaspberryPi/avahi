Set up according to:
http://elinux.org/RPi_Advanced_Setup

Copy of the relavnt section:

Install avahi with the following commands on the Pi:
sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon
and then on older Debian installs:
sudo update-rc.d avahi-daemon defaults
or on newer Raspbian installs:
sudo insserv avahi-daemon
(if in doubt, you're probably on the newer one).
Create a configfile for Avahi at /etc/avahi/services/multiple.service. I did this with the following command:
sudo pico /etc/avahi/services/multiple.service
The contents of this file should be something like the following, courtesy of aXon on the Rasperry Pi forums:
<?xml version="1.0" standalone='no'?>
<!DOCTYPE service-group SYSTEM "avahi-service.dtd">
<service-group>
        <name replace-wildcards="yes">%h</name>
        <service>
                <type>_device-info._tcp</type>
                <port>0</port>
                <txt-record>model=RackMac</txt-record>
        </service>
        <service>
                <type>_ssh._tcp</type>
                <port>22</port>
        </service>
</service-group>
Apply the new configuration with:
sudo /etc/init.d/avahi-daemon restart
The Pi should now be addressable from other machines as raspberrypi.local, for example:
ssh pi@raspberrypi.local


My /etc/avahi/services/multiple.service config is:


pi@raspberrypi ~ $ cat /etc/avahi/services/multiple.service 
<?xml version="1.0" standalone='no'?>
<!DOCTYPE service-group SYSTEM "avahi-service.dtd">
<service-group>
        <name replace-wildcards="yes">%h</name>
        <service>
                <type>_device-info._tcp</type>
                <port>0</port>
                <txt-record>model=LogoBot</txt-record>
        </service>
        <service>
                <type>_fish._tcp</type>
                <port>12347</port>
        </service>
</service-group>
